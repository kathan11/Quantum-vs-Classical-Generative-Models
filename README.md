# Quantum vs Classical Generative Models

This project explores and compares the performance of classical and quantum generative models in the context of molecular generation. We evaluate models including Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Wasserstein GANs (WGAN), and Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBM) on SMILES-derived molecular fingerprints.

Our goal is to investigate whether quantum models offer any practical advantages over classical models in low-data and evaluation-limited regimes ‚Äî a step toward identifying **Potential Practical Quantum Advantage (PPQA)** in real-world applications like drug discovery.
